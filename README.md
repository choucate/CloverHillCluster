# CloverHillCluster
Puppet DRBD Pacemaker Local cluster

The idea here is to create and maintain a fully automated DRBD cluster.
There will be three nodes on CentOS 7.7 in this cluster and they will be using the applications below:
Puppet for package management;
Corosync for service HA;
Pacemaker for service HA;
DRBD for block storage.
